sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

if you get an error like: "Errors were encountered while processing: google-chrome-stable" it is because some dependencies are missing. To fix that enter the following command:

sudo apt-get -f install

Then you should be able to run the installation without problems:

sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

To run Google Chrome type in terminal "google-chrome" or click the icon in the menu.
