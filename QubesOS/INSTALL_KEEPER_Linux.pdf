   README FOR LINUX or command line execution
=======================-------------------------------

Thank you for downloading Keeper Desktop for your Linux computer.

In order to run Keeper, you just need to make sure your Java Virtual
Machine is up-to-date.  Visit http://www.java.com/getjava/ to 
install the latest version.

The latest version is always located at the following URL:
https://keepersecurity.com/download

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Create a folder to put the app

$ mkdir KeeperDesktop

2.  Extract KeeperDesktopLinux.zip

$ unzip KeeperDesktopLinux.zip

3.  Run it 

$ java -Xms256m -Xmx1g -jar KeeperDesktop.jar

You may want to add a parameter like -d32 or -d64 which will tell the Java VM to utilize the appropriate 32/64-bit version.  
This can speed up the encryption performance by 10x depending on the machine and java version.  The second and third parameters
tell the Java VM how much memory to allocate and allow for the application.
You can adjust these params as you see fit for your system's setup.

After you launch Keeper, you'll find a new folder in your home directory, i.e.:

/home/<username>/KeeperData

If you want to create an executable shell script then just make it look like this:

----
cd <install folder>
java -Xms256m -Xmx1g -jar KeeperDesktop.jar
----

NOTES:

Inside this folder is keeper.sql which is an SQLite3 format database.  

If you enjoy using Keeper on Linux and you would like us to continue supporting
this platform, please tell your Linux friends to download the app.
